# LoA
Data and R files for creating limits of agreement based on transformed measurements. The simulated data and analyses corresponds to those in the manuscript "Limits of agreement based on transformed measurements". 

# Data
* dfi_sim.RData: simulated data corresponding to the sperm DNA fragmentation index (DFI) data
* plaque_sim.RData: simulated data corresponding to the coronary plaque volume measurements data

# Templates
* Template_log.R: The LoA analysis using a logarithmic transformation using the dfi_sim data set.
* Template_cubic.R: The LoA analysis using a cubic transformation using the plaque_sim data set.
